# jQuery and SASS Very Simple Introduction

## jQuery

Weâ€™ll use jQuery to create a [very simple app](https://ULL-ESIT-GRADOII-DSI.github.io/jquery-simple-example) that allows the user to
enter some text, which subsequently will be appended to the page
in a different place. 

## SASS

For the style we use [sass](http://sass-lang.com/guide).

To compile the style:

```bash
sass style.scss style.css
```

 In addition, you can watch folders or directories with the `--watch` flag. 
An example of running Sass while watching an entire directory is the following:

```bash
sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets
```
